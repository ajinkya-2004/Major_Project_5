Objective: To create a full-stack application where users can manage their recipes, create meal plans, and generate shopping lists.

Key Features:

User Accounts: Registration, login, profile with dietary preferences/allergies.
Recipe Management:
Users can add their own recipes (ingredients, instructions, categories, notes).
(Advanced) Integration with an external recipe API (e.g., Edamam, Spoonacular) to search for and import recipes.
Ability to mark recipes as favorites.
Meal Planning:
Users can drag-and-drop recipes onto a weekly calendar to create meal plans.
Ability to plan for different meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks).
Shopping List Generation:
Automatically generate a shopping list based on the ingredients in the planned meals for a selected date range.
Option to manually add/remove items from the shopping list.
Ability to mark items as purchased.
Search & Filter: Search recipes by name, ingredients, dietary tags, etc.
Performance Optimization: Consider caching frequently accessed external API recipe data on the backend.
Web Security: Focus on secure user authentication and authorization, input validation for user-added recipes.
Technologies:
Front-End: React.js (for interactive calendar/planner and recipe display).
Back-End: Node.js with Express.js.
Database: MongoDB (flexible for varied recipe structures and user preferences) or PostgreSQL/MySQL (if you prefer more strict relational modeling of recipes and ingredients).
Other: JWT for authentication, Bcrypt for password hashing, external API integration (Fetch/Axios).
